							<p>
								To run any of our feed systems, it requires a DAC and Controls system. For safety reasons, these operations must be done 
								remotely and the operator must be able to see live data so that if anything goes wrong, they can account for it. My primary
								responsibility in the lab is the maintennance and creation of this software. 
								
							</p>
							<p>
								This software's base functionality is recording live data from pressure transducers, thermocouplers, and lode cells and displaying them 
								live to the operator via ethernet every 10 milliseconds. Additionally, it can also remotely actuate solenoids and stepper motors
								with minimal latency. Since the lab's needs are always changing, this code is constantly adding additional functionality to suit the lab's
								needs. There are also config files that the operater can edit to customize the DAC such as changing the sensor's polling rate and display rate
								of these readings. Click <a href = "https://github.com/LPL-DAQ/flightAvionics" target="_blank"> here </a> to see the DAC's Github repository. 
							</p>

								This spring, the lab was also able to hot fire one of our engines, below is a video of our hot fire using the DAC software.

							<p>
								This database implementation makes use of the FoundationDB (FDB) API. It utilizes FDB's key-value system to store data entries based on
								primary keys and attributes. The setup employs a table-record structure that lets users create cursor objects. With these cursors, users 
								can iterate through all records that satisfy the user's search criteria. Additionally, these cursors can update and delete these data
								entries as well.
							</p>
							<p>
								Cursors can iterate in either value order or based on the attribute's hash value. The implementation also handles relation algebra statements
								between two cursors. This implementation adheres to the four properties of ACID, which ensures data integrity and mitigates the potential 
								for data loss.

								This text classifier will classify a piece of text as either positive or negative. To pre-process the data, I first took the training 
								data and tokenized each unique word by popularity. To ensure all data had the same length, I selected a review length that at least
								70% of the training data had. For pre-processing purposes, any text above that length will be truncated and any length below it will
								be zero padded. To yield better results, I added an embedding layer with the top 5,000 words.  
							</p>
							<p>
								After pre-processing the data, I then used the training data to train 3 models to see their accuracies. All three of these models utilized
								Keras to create multi-layered training models. The first model consists of three layers each consisting of 50 ReLU layer with dropout rates
								of 25, 50, and 50 respectively. It then uses a single sigmoid neuron as its final layer. The second model consists of a

							<p>
								Following the data preprocessing phase, I proceeded to employ the training data in training three distinct models, with a focus on assessing 
								their respective accuracies. All three models were developed using the Keras framework, constructing intricate multi-layered training models. 
								The initial model comprised three layers, each housing 50 ReLU units accompanied by dropout rates of 25%, 50%, and 50%, sequentially. A single 
								sigmoid neuron served as the final layer. Moving on, the second model featured a one-dimensional convolutional network, while the third model 
								was built around a long short-term memory recurrent neural network structure. In this structure, every word was treated as a 32-dimensional 
								vector, succeeded by a dense layer comprising 256 ReLUs. The training and test accuracies for each of these models have also been provided for 
								reference.

								This classifier performs the task of categorizing movie reviews into either positive or negative sentiments. It employs a streamlined approach, 
								featuring a solitary-layered neuron that is immediately succeeded by a sigmoid function. This architecture works harmoniously to ascertain whether
								a given movie review holds a positive or negative stance.

							<p>
								The game Fool's Dice is a game where players roll a dice with the aim of reaching a specific score within a limited number of lives. 
								Each player begins with both a permanent and temporary score of 0. Rolling a number from 1 to 5 allows the player to increase their 
								temporary score by that amount. Conversely, rolling a 6 resets the temporary score to 0 and results in a deduction of 1 life.
							</p>
							<p>
								After each roll, players face a choice: they can either transfer their temporary score to the permanent one, at the expense of a life, or 
								they can opt to hold. The conclusion of the game hinges on either the exhaustion of the player's allotted lives or the attainment of 
								a permanent score equal to or exceeding the designated target score.
							</p>
							<p>
								Employing Markov's Decision Process, the following code functions to advise players whether to deposit their scores or to continue holding, 
								based on the present game state.
